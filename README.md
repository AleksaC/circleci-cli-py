A python package that provides a pip-installable
[CircleCI CLI](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli) binary.

The mechanism by which the binary is downloaded is basically copied from
[shellcheck-py](https://github.com/shellcheck-py/shellcheck-py).

## Getting started

### Installation

The package hasn't been published to PyPI yet, and may never be, as its primary
purpose doesn't require it. However you can install it through git:

```shell script
pip install git+git://github.com/AleksaC/circleci-cli-py.git@v0.1.29658
```

### With pre-commit

This package was primarily built to provide a convenient way of running hadolint
as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook, since pre-commit seems unable to
install it as a golang hook.

Example `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/AleksaC/circleci-cli-py
    rev: v0.1.29658
    hooks:
      - id: circle-ci-validator
```
